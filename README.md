1. Have an input
Example:20
2. initialize an empty array
Example: num []
3. get the range of numbers from 1 to the input 
Example:1,2,3,4,5.3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20
4. store the input in an array num =[1,2,3,4,5.3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]
5. get the numbers in the array that are divible to 3 and replace them with "ping"
Example:[1,2,ping,4,5,ping,7,8,ping,10,11,ping,13,14,ping,16,17,ping,19,20]
6.get the numbers in the array divisible with 5 and replace with "pong"
Example:[1,2,ping,4,pong,ping,7,8,ping,pong,11,ping,13,14,ping,16,17,ping,19,ping]
7. get the numbers in the array divisible with both 3 and 5 and replace with "pingpong"
Example:[1,2,ping,4,5,ping,7,8,ping,10,11,ping,13,14,pingpong,16,17,ping,19,20]
